# Calm Command Center

A dark, atmospheric portfolio site built to feel like a calm operator's dashboard — serious, minimal, and alive.

## What it is

A multi-page portfolio with an animated background made of pulsing red glows and floating geometric shapes. The design language is dark and editorial: near-black background, red accents, and serif typography (Playfair Display + Crimson Text) to create a dramatic but restrained presence.

Navigation adapts to context — a transparent top bar at rest, a floating right-side pill when scrolling, and a full-screen overlay on mobile.

## Pages

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Home — hero, principles, email capture |
| `/work` | Selected projects |
| `/lab` | Open source tools and experiments |
| `/journal` | Writing on systems and operations |
| `/about` | Who's behind this |
| `/contact` | Direct contact |

## What's inside

- **Navbar** — scroll-aware navigation: top bar at rest, vertical pill on the right when scrolled (fades until hovered), full-screen overlay on mobile with a `☰` trigger
- **BeatingBrain** — four layered red blobs that pulse at different speeds, creating an organic breathing atmosphere in the background
- **RollingHeptagon** — three 7-sided shapes that wander across the screen along different paths and speeds, each with a small ball rolling inside
- **Hero section** — name, tagline, three guiding principles, and an email capture form for launch signups
- **ImageWithFallback** — utility component that gracefully handles broken image URLs with a clean placeholder
